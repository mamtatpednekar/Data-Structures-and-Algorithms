Heirarchical structure with parents and children
Can have atmost two children 
We can perform traversals on binary tree
There are three types-
  1. Preorder Traversal 
    Node Left Right 

void preorderTraversal(TreeNode node){
if(node != null)
  visit(node);
  preorderTraversal(node.left)
  preorderTraversal(node.right)
}
}
  2. Inorder Traversal 
    Left Node Right 

void inorderTraversal(TreeNode node)
{
if (node != null){
  inorderTraversal(node.left);
  visit(node);
  inorderTraversal(node.right);
}
}
  3. Postorder Traversal 
    Left Right Node

void postorderTraversal(TreeNode node){
if(node != null){
  postoredrTraversal(node.left);
  postorderTraversal(node.right);
  visit(node);
}

Differences between Graph and Tree
1. Tree cannot be discconnected
2. Tree cannot be cyclic/closed
3. Tree is always pointing downwards and there are no arrows 
4. Tree can have only 1 parent

A tree is called a k-ary tree where k is the no of children

Complete tree
A tree which has the nodes filled up from left to right 

Perfect tree 
A tree which has zero children or atleast the k-ary children

Full tree
A tree where each leaf node has the same depth
